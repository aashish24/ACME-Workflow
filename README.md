ACME-Workflow
=============

Pegasus workflow for ACME climate models.

Consult the [CESM User's Guide](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/cesm/doc/usersguide/book1.html)
for more information about the climate code used by this workflow.

On Hopper
---------
You need to create the case while logged into Hopper.

In the following, assume that these variables are set to the values below:

    ACMEPATH = /global/project/projectdirs/m2187/acme_code/ACME
    CASENAME = F1850.g37.case2
    SCRATCHDIR = /scratch/scratchdirs/juve/
    CASEDIR = $SCRATCHDIR/$CASENAME

Note that the "shared-scratch" directory in your site catalog must match the
value for SCRATCHDIR above. This is because we use CASENAME as the --relative-dir
option for the Pegasus planner so that CASEDIR will become Pegasus' scratch dir.

1. Create the case directory. From $ACMEPATH/scripts run:

    $ ./create_newcase -case $CASEDIR -mach hopper -compset F1850 -res T31_g37 -project m2187

 In this case "m2187" is our Hopper project ID, and "mach" means "machine"
 and should be set to "hopper". The "compset" defines the component set, or the
 set of model components and configuration you want to use, and "res" specifies
 the resolution, or grid setting. Possible compsets include: F1850, B1850. 
 Possible grids include: ne30_g16, T31_g37.

2. Make any manual changes to the case that are required for your simulation.

3. Setup the case. From $CASEDIR run:

    $ ./cesm_setup

4. Compile the code. This should take about 20 minutes. From $CASEDIR run:

    $ ./$CASENAME.build


On Submit Host
--------------

1. Create/edit the configuration file (e.g. test.cfg)

 a. Set "casename" to match the name of your case.

 b. Set "mppwidth" to match the $CASENAME.run script in your case dir

 c. Set "stop_n" and "walltime" to create the number of stages you want
    the workflow to have.

2. Generate the DAX

    $ python daxgen.py test.cfg $CASENAME

3. Edit the site catalog, sites.xml:

 a. Update the "shared-scratch" directory entry to have your username

 b. Update the "shared-storage" directory entry

4. Plan the DAX

    $ ./plan.sh $CASENAME

5. Get NERSC grid proxy using:

    $ myproxy-logon -s nerscca.nersc.gov:7512 -t 24 -T -l YOUR_NERSC_USERNAME

6. Follow output of plan.sh to submit workflow

    $ pegasus-run $CASENAME/submit/$CASENAME

7. Monitor the workflow:

    $ pegasus-status -l $CASENAME/submit/$CASENAME
